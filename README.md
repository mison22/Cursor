## üöÄ Quick Start

1. **Install Cursor**: Download from [cursor.sh](https://cursor.sh)
2. **Choose your configuration**:
   - For Rails-only projects: Copy `.cursorrules` to your project root
   - For full-stack projects: Copy `cursorrules_fullstack_complete` as `.cursorrules` to your project root
3. **Read the guides**: 
   - Start with `CURSOR_GUIDE.md` for general usage
   - For Rails-only assessments: Use `ASSESSMENT_GUIDE.md`
   - For full-stack assessments (React/TypeScript + Rails): Use `FULLSTACK_ASSESSMENT_GUIDE.md`

## üéØ Key Features

### For General Development
- AI-powered code completion and generation
- Multi-file editing and refactoring
- Code review and debugging assistance
- Documentation generation
- Test writing and optimization

### For Rails Assessments
- Structured 3-hour implementation plan
- Time management strategies
- Cursor interaction best practices
- Common pitfalls and solutions
- Emergency troubleshooting

### For Full-Stack Assessments
- React/TypeScript + Rails API coordination
- Frontend-backend integration strategies
- Managing two codebases with Cursor
- Testing both frontend and backend
- Deployment preparation and considerations

## üìã Usage Examples

### Basic Cursor Chat
```bash
# Open chat with Cmd/Ctrl + L
"I need to create a User model with email validation and secure password hashing"
```

### Using @ Mentions
```bash
"@Files:user_controller.rb Review this controller for error handling improvements"
"@Folder:models Generate tests for all model validations"
```

### Assessment Workflow

**Rails-Only Assessment:**
```bash
# Phase 1: Planning
"Help me plan the implementation for this Rails assessment PRD: [paste requirements]"

# Phase 2: Implementation
"Generate the User model with associations and validations"

# Phase 3: Testing
"Create RSpec tests for the UserController covering happy paths and edge cases"
```

**Full-Stack Assessment:**
```bash
# Phase 1: Planning
"Help me plan the full-stack implementation: React frontend + Rails API backend"

# Phase 2: Backend Implementation
"Generate the Rails API endpoints with proper serializers"

# Phase 3: Frontend Implementation
"Create React components with TypeScript types matching the API"

# Phase 4: Integration & Testing
"Test the full flow from React component to Rails API"
```

### Practice Assessment Workflow
```bash
# 1. Run the setup script
bash setup_omada_practice.sh

# 2. Navigate to the project
cd omada_practice

# 3. Copy your .cursorrules file
cp ~/.cursorrules .cursorrules

# 4. Start following the Assessment Guide with the PRD_Clean.md as your requirements
# Follow the step-by-step process in ASSESSMENT_GUIDE.md
```

## üîß Configuration

### Rails-only Configuration (`.cursorrules`)
